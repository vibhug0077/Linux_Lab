# Linux Lab (August â€“ December 2025)

This repository contains all lab materials, scripts, and experiments for the **Linux Lab course** conducted during **August â€“ December 2025**.  
It is designed to help students gain hands-on experience with Linux commands, shell scripting, system administration, and automation tasks.

##  Repository Structure

- **Scripts/**  
  Contains all lab experiment scriptsâ€”organized by topic or week.

- **Unit â€“1 â€“ Linux Basics/**  
  Introductory content for the first unit on Linux fundamentals.

- **images/**  
  Contains visual assets used in lab documents, reports, or presentations.

##  Index of Experiments & Scripts

Below is an example layoutâ€”please adjust or fill in with actual script names and folder names from your repo.

### Unit â€“1: Linux Basics
- [Unit â€“1 â€“ Linux Basics](https://github.com/vibhug0077/Linux_Lab/tree/main/Unit%20â€“1%20â€“%20Linux%20Basics)  
  Introductory notes and resources for the Linux basics unit.

### Lab Scripts
Inside **Scripts/**, you might have topics like:

- [Topic A Script](https://github.com/vibhug0077/Linux_Lab/tree/main/Scripts/<script-folder-or-file-name-here>) â€“ Description of this scriptâ€™s task.
- [Topic B Script](https://github.com/vibhug0077/Linux_Lab/tree/main/Scripts/<script-folder-or-file-name-here>) â€“ Description of this scriptâ€™s task.

*( Continue listing all script files or subfolders here with meaningful labels. )*

##  Notes

- Each script or topic folder should include a README or clear naming convention describing its purpose and expected outcomes.
- Feel free to **edit or reorganize** the folder titles for clarityâ€”especially replacing spaces or symbols if needed for easier linking.
- As the course progresses, you may add new folders (e.g., **Unit 2**, **Automation**, **Networking**) in a similar manner.

##  Next Step

Could you share the **exact names** of the files or subfolders inside the **Scripts/** folder (and optionally what's inside **Unit â€“1 â€“ Linux Basics**)? Once I have that, I can help create a polished, clickable index with proper descriptions that mirrors your repo exactly.

---

## üîπ 1. Understanding File Permissions in Linux

Each file/directory in Linux has:

* **Owner** ‚Üí The user who created the file.
* **Group** ‚Üí A group of users who may share access.
* **Others** ‚Üí Everyone else.

### Permission Types

* **r** ‚Üí Read (4 in numeric)
* **w** ‚Üí Write (2 in numeric)
* **x** ‚Üí Execute (1 in numeric)

### Permission Layout

Example from `ls -l`:

```
-rwxr-xr--
```

Breakdown:

* `-` ‚Üí Regular file (`d` = directory, `l` = symlink, etc.)
* `rwx` ‚Üí Owner has read, write, execute
* `r-x` ‚Üí Group has read, execute
* `r--` ‚Üí Others have read only

## üîπ 2. `chmod` ‚Äì Change File Permissions

### Syntax

```bash
chmod [options] mode filename
```

Modes can be set in **numeric (octal)** or **symbolic** form.

---

### (A) Numeric (Octal) Method

Each permission is represented as a number:

* Read = 4
* Write = 2
* Execute = 1

Add them up:

* `7 = rwx`
* `6 = rw-`
* `5 = r-x`
* `4 = r--`
* `0 = ---`

#### Example:

```bash
chmod 755 script.sh
```

Meaning:

* Owner: 7 ‚Üí `rwx`
* Group: 5 ‚Üí `r-x`
* Others: 5 ‚Üí `r-x`

---

### (B) Symbolic Method

Use `u` (user/owner), `g` (group), `o` (others), `a` (all).
Operators:

* `+` ‚Üí Add permission
* `-` ‚Üí Remove permission
* `=` ‚Üí Assign exact permission

#### Examples:

```bash
chmod u+x script.sh     # Add execute for owner
chmod g-w notes.txt     # Remove write from group
chmod o=r file.txt      # Set others to read only
chmod a+r report.txt    # Everyone gets read access
```

---

### (C) Recursive Changes

```bash
chmod -R 755 /mydir
```

* `-R` ‚Üí applies changes recursively to all files/subdirectories.

---

## üîπ 3. `chown` ‚Äì Change File Ownership

### Syntax

```bash
chown [options] new_owner:new_group filename
```

### Examples:

```bash
chown vibhu file.txt           # Change owner to user 'vibhu'
chown vibhu:dev file.txt       # Change owner to 'vibhu' and group to 'dev'
chown :dev file.txt            # Change only group to 'dev'
chown -R vibhu:dev /project    # Recursive ownership change
```

---

## üîπ 4. Putting It All Together

### Example Scenario

```bash
touch project.sh
ls -l project.sh
```

Output:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 vibhu dev 0 Aug 19 12:00 project.sh
```

Now:

```bash
chmod 700 project.sh       # Only owner has rwx
chmod u+x,g-w project.sh   # Add execute for user, remove write for group
chown root:admin project.sh # Change owner to root and group to admin
```

## üîπ 5. Quick Reference Table

| Numeric | Permission | Meaning      |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| 0       | ---        | No access    |
| 1       | --x        | Execute only |
| 2       | -w-        | Write only   |
| 3       | -wx        | Write + Exec |
| 4       | r--        | Read only    |
| 5       | r-x        | Read + Exec  |
| 6       | rw-        | Read + Write |
| 7       | rwx        | Full access  |

---

‚úÖ **Key Tip**: Use **numeric for quick settings** (e.g., 755, 644) and **symbolic for fine adjustments** (`u+x`, `g-w`).
